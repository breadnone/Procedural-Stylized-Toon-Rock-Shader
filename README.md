# Procedural-Stylized-Toon-Rock-Shader
Procedurally generating stylized/toon rock texture coupled with toon lightings  
  No textures required as they're procedurally generated. Don't forget to copy the custom lighting to your assets folder and assign it in the customfunction node once this shader installed in your project.
  
  
Special thanks to MinionsArt for it's custom lighting used in this shader
